# ChatGPT-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis

- Primary goal is to examine the varied viewpoints held by ChatGPT users.
- One of the most recent breakthroughs by Open AI, ChatGPT is used all over the world and is used to help user with their issues.
- Understanding the user's feelings and opinions regarding ChatGPT innovation helps us choose what other areas we should research and develop in the future and also how can we improve the existing innovation and make much more work done.
- We must examine the feedback and data we receive from a variety of sources in order to understand this. One of the sources from which I am  categorizing the user perspectives is through the tweets they publish on Twitter about ChatGPT.
- We categorize the data using these tweets and preprocess it by removing extraneous information such stop words, hashtags, and punctuations, etc. and clean the code to train the model and get accurate scores at the end.
